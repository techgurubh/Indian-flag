# 🇮🇳 Indian Flag Hoisting Simulation

An interactive, web-based simulation of the Indian National Flag hoisting ceremony. This project uses HTML5 Canvas for realistic wave physics and CSS3 transitions for the hoisting animation.

## 🚀 Live Demo

## 🌟 Features
* **Physics-based Animation:** The flag uses a sine-wave algorithm to simulate wind movement, with an "anchor" effect so the fabric remains attached to the pole.
* **Hoisting Mechanism:** A smooth 4-second transition that moves the flag from the base to the top of the pole.
* **Procedural Chakra:** The Ashoka Chakra is drawn dynamically using JavaScript with all 24 spokes.
* **Responsive Design:** Features a sky-gradient background and a 3-step structural base.

## 🛠️ Built With
* **HTML5:** Structure and Canvas API.
* **CSS3:** Flexbox layout, CSS Variables, and transitions.
* **JavaScript (ES6):** Animation loops and event handling.

## 🇮🇳 Respect the Code
This project was built for educational and patriotic purposes. It adheres to the **Flag Code of India**, maintaining proper proportions and a respectful display of the *Tiranga*.

 "A flag is not only a symbol of our independence but also of the collective pride of all Indians."
